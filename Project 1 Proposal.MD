# Duck Boulder

## Concept

This is a throwback to the good old 8-bit/16-bit era days.  Duck Boulder is heavily inspired by games like Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and
DuckTales.  Recent games such as Shovel Knight have been a good inspiration as well.

## Platformer

As suggested by the concept information above, this game will most certainly be a platformer.  There will be quite a bit of levels to explore
and secrets to discover!

## Art Direction

The game protagnist will have similar features to that of Donald Duck.  He will be wearing attire meant for an explorer (kind of like QuackShot for the Sega Genesis) 
and the game will be full of vivid colors. I want to try and emulate the parallax scrolling style as well as a nod to mode 7 effects.

## Plot

While I don't have a solid idea for the story yet, I figure a rescue mission as well as bringing down a powerful foe will be the catalyst.

## Gameplay

The protagnist will have the ability to morph into a big boulder and crush various enemies/breakable environments.  There will be plenty of secrets to discovery 
by double jumping in the air.

## Controls

The game will obvious utilize the arrow keys and possible the space bar for the jump/boulder morph.  I'd like to implement a way for the user to select/customize their control style.  I plan on a mobile release as well, which will make use of touchscreen based controls.  I'd like to also include optional joypad support.

## Development

I've had this game idea in my head for the past couple of years.  I have put it on the back burner for other projects which included other games and music composing.  While I don't have much concept art at the moment, I do have some sketch ideas for enemies that will soon be posted.
